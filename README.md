ListenBrainz API bindings for Rust.

There is also [listenbrainz-rust](https://crates.io/crates/listenbrainz-rust). However, that crate
only supports single listens, imports and now playing requests, and is also not maintained anymore.
This crate, on the other hand, aims to be a complete API wrapper for the ListenBrainz API,
version 1.
